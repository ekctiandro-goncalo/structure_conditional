# 🧠 C Fundamentals — Conditional Logic Exercises

This repository contains a set of **basic C programming exercises** focused on practicing **conditional statements**, **comparisons**, and **user input handling**.

These exercises are part of my learning journey while rebuilding my foundations in C programming.

## 📌 Exercises Overview

### 🔹 Exercise 1 — Even or Odd Checker
The program asks the user to enter a number and checks whether it is **even or odd** using the modulus operator (`%`).

**Concepts practiced:**
- User input with `scanf`
- Modulus operator
- `if / else` conditions

---

### 🔹 Exercise 2 — Exact Value Match
The program compares a user-provided number with a predefined value.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Equality comparison (`==`)
- Conditional execution
- Simple game-style logic

---

### 🔹 Exercise 3 — Greater or Equal Comparison
The program checks whether the user's input is **greater than or equal to** a predefined value.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Relational operators (`>=`)
- Conditional branching
- Input validation logic

---

### 🔹 Exercise 4 — Value Guessing (Retry Logic Base)
A simple guessing logic where the user must match a predefined value.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Comparison logic
- Control flow
- Preparation for loop-based games

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- Standard C Library (`stdio.h`)
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
